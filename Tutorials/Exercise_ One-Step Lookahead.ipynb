You will define these values in the code cell below.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FBoWr2f.png\" width=80%><br/>\n</center>\n    \n\nTo check your answer, we use your values to create a heuristic function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_heuristic_q1(grid, col, mark, config):\n    num_twos = count_windows(grid, 2, mark, config)\n    num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n    num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n    num_twos_opp = count_windows(grid, 2, mark%2+1, config)\n    num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n    score = A*num_fours + B*num_threes + C*num_twos + D*num_twos_opp + E*num_threes_opp\n    return score\n```\n\nThis heuristic is then used to create an agent, that competes against the agent from the tutorial in 50 different game rounds.  In order to be marked correct, \n- your agent must win at least half of the games, and\n- `C` and `D` must both be nonzero."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Assign reward values to the conditions\nA = 1000000\nB = 100\nC = 1\nD = -10\nE = -1000\n\n# Check your answer (this will take a few seconds to run!)\nq_1.check()","execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"Your Agent's Win Percentage (in 50 game rounds): 0.0\nTutorial Agent's Win Percentage (in 50 game rounds): 0.0\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"outcomeType\": 2, \"failureMessage\": \"Your agent's win percentage was only 0.0\\\\%.
